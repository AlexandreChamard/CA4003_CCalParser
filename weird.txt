facts :
1. only functions can be void
2. error rule 34 with rule 45


weird:
* we can't parse "-func()" but we can parse "0-func()" and "-x"
* we can't parse <condition> like "true", "false"
* we can parse <condition> likes "func1() == true && func1() == true" but not "func1() && func2()"
* we can parse <condition> likes "~ 10 < 30 && 1 == 1" that is "(~ (10 < 30)) && 1 == 1" or "~(10 < 30 && 1 == 1)" ?
* we can parse <condition> likes "1+2==3" but with operator precedence it does "1+(2==3)".
